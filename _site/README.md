# Chitrakaavya

### Please check the [homepage](https://vrraghy.github.io/chitrakaavya/) for the posts published.


This project aims to showcase & represent Chitrakaavyas, just for their sheer beauty, inspired by [@suhasm](https://twitter.com/suhasm)'s [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXBYNZ4GaVQ).

If you wish to contribute, please reache me on [@vrraghy](https://twitter.com/vrraghy), as I'm not too familiar with Git yet & hence can't accept pull requests.

Huge thanks to the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) project, and [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) for his wonderful [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme used here.
