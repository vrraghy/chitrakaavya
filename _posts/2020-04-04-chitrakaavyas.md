A lof of us love poetry (kaavya). Chitrakavya is a kind of poem written with constraints in addition to the existing contraints like meters, etc., due to which they always exceed a reader's expectations.

Imagine walking through a gallery of paintings, and I hope this gives you a similar experience.

## Letter constraints: वर्ण-चित्र
It is tradition to start with an auspicious verse, and here's a chitrakaavya written by yours truly -

<!--
अरातिरातनोरात्त नारी तनुरनुत्तर: ।
तन्तनीतु त्रिनेत्रो निरार्तितां नो निरान्तरम् ॥
-->

> ### अ<r>रा</r><o>ति</o><r>रा</r><o>त</o>नो<r>रा</r><o>त्त</o> ना<r>री</r> <o>त</o>नु<r>र</r>नु<o>त्त</o><r>र:</r> ।
> ### <o>त</o>न्<o>त</o>नी<o>तु</o> <o>त्रि</o>ने<o>त्रो</o> नि<r>रा</r><o>र्तितां</o> नो नि<r>रा</r>न्<o>त</o><r>र</r>म् ॥
> ### May three-eyed Shiva grant us good health. He is enemy of Love God, shares his body with Parvati as Ardhanarishvara, and is supreme.
{:style="text-align:center"}

If you haven't noticed yet, this contains only 3 consonants: **र**, **त** & **न**!

There can be other kinds of contraints too, and the results get increasingly interesting. Here's a verse which uses only 2 consonants - **र** & **त** - from [Vallabhadeva's *Subhashitavali (34,11)*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.70521/page/n39/mode/2up)

<!--
तारतारतरेरैतैरुत्तरोत्तरो रुतै: ।
रतार्ता तित्तिरी रौति तीरॆ तीरॆ तरौ तरौ ॥
-->
> ### ता<r>र</r>ता<r>र</r>त<r>रेरै</r>तै<r>रु</r>त्त<r>रो</r>त्त<r>रो रु</r>तै: ।
> ### <r>र</r>तार्ता तित्ति<r>री रौ</r>ति ती<r>रॆ</r> ती<r>रॆ</r> त<r>रौ</r> त<r>रौ</r> ॥
> ### The love-sick *tittiri* bird cries out on every bank, on every tree, again and againm growing shriller and shriller
{:style="text-align:center"}


The choice of these consonants is surely not a random one, for these are some of the most frequent ones in the Sanskrit lexicon, which is why, a similar attempt with the consonants **ट** / **ठ** / **ढ** / **घ** would not be an easy one, simply because there are not as many words with them. So, there's quite a lot of thought involved in creating one, and even with these calculations, it's certainly a challenge, nonetheless.

## Other languages

Now, Sanskrit takes this art-form to heights unknown in other languages, but we do come across such. Charles Carroll Bombaugh, in of his [selections of such whimsical works](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56805/56805-h/56805-h.htm) full of alliterations, anagrams has a few *univocalic* verses - where only one syllable is used. e.g.

> ### No cool monsoons blow soft on Oxford dons,
> ### Orthodox, jog-trot, book-worm Solomons!

## Lipograms
A lipogram is one which omits a certain letter, and probably the greatest such work in English is Ernest Vincent Wright’s 1939 novel [Gadsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel)) - it contains over 50,000 words but not a single instance of the letter **e**!

In Sanskrit too, there's an interesting application of a lipogram, employed not just as a challenge but with a poetic intent in itself, by the famous scholar [Daṇḍi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Di) who was possibly from the historic city of Kanchipuram, South India.
Written in the 7<sup>th</sup> or 8<sup>th</sup> century CE, one of his famous & surviving works, [Dashakumaracharita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashakumaracharita) is a tale of 10 young men who get separated for various reasons and later narrate each of their adventures upon reuniting, making for a joyous read. In the 7<sup>th</sup> chapter comes the turn for *Mantragupta* to relate his adventures.

When it comes to be the turn of *Mantragupta* to relate his adventures, he finds it painful to close his swollen lips as a result of all the nibbling by his beloved, during the passionate lovemaking the previous night, and hence refrains from using any labial consonants (**प**,**फ**,**ब**,**भ**,**म**) throughout his narrative!

> ### स किल करकमलनेन किंचित्संवृत्ताननो ललितवल्लभारभसदत्त दन्त क्षतव्य सनविह्व लाधर मणिर्निरोष्ठ्य वर्णं आत्मचरितं आचचक्षॆ
> That man (*Mantragupta*) half-covMantraguptaered his face with his lotus-like hands before beginning his own story. For his ruby lips were in an agony of agitation, perforated with bite marks that this beloved had bestowed in her forceful love-play. Hence he was compelled to speak without the labial lip sounds:p, b and m.

**Lipograms as a plot device**

अवान्तिसुन्दरीकथासार:, a summary of अवान्तिसुन्दरीकथा, another work by Daṇḍi has a character *Somadatta*, when afflicted by fever, and hence speaks only using the gentle consonants! It also makes one think if the author was alluding to the Tamil alphabets while writing in Sanskrit!

> ### सोमादत्तत: सुहृत्प्रेम्णा स्वस्थीभूत: स तै: सह ।
> ### प्रच्छाये क्कचनासीनो निगृह्य ज्वरवेदनाम् ।।
> ### वर्गाद्यन्तान्तस्यै र्ऋऌवर्णविवर्जितै: स्वरैर्मृदुभि: ।
> ### स चतुर्विंशतिवर्णै: स्वचरितमनुवर्णयांचके ।।
{:style="text-align:center"}

### Pangrams
A sentence that contains all the alphabets is called a pangram, and a lot of us would be familiar with this popular one
> A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
{:style="text-align:center"}
**Manavalli Gangadhara Sastri** (1834-1914), a *shatavadhani*  - one who performs a hundred things in parallel - was once given the following line as a prompt
> ### बभौ मयूरो लवशॆषसिंह:
{:style="text-align:center"}
where the consonants are in the order their alphabetical order, and he replied
> ### अनॆकवर्ण क्रमरीतियुक्त: कखागघाङच्छजझ्रा ञटौ ठ: ।
> ### अडण्ढणस्तोऽथ दधौ न पम्फुल् बभौ मयूरो लवशॆषसिंह:
{:style="text-align:center"}
### Hidden Fourth Line / गूढचतुर्थपाद:
The constraint here is on the fourth line in that no new letter should be used. An verse from Kirātārjunīyam (15.43) shows how it's done!
> ###  **द्यु****वि**यद्मा**मि**नी
> ###  **ता**र**सं**राववि**ह**तश्रु**ति:** ।
> ###  हैमाषुमाला शुशुभॆ
> ###  **विद्युतामिव संहति:** ॥
> ###  Shiva's golden arrows went across the sky
> ###  like shining lightning, making a loud bang
{:style="text-align:center"}

## Oulipo
Short for ***Ou**vroir de **li**ttérature **po**tentielle*, meaning *"workshop of potential literature"*, Oulipo is a group of French writers & mathematicians who seek to create works using constrained writing techniques, their motivation being
> *Only if you  constrain the writing, you can understand the true potential of what language can make us do!*

## Palindromes: विलोमकाव्य
Palindromes those words / sentences which read the same forwards & backwards. Here's a Greek palindrome which was inscribed upon a holy water font outside the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, giving a splash of poetry.

>  ΝΊΨΟΝ ἈΝΟΜΉΜΑΤΑ, ΜῊ ΜΌΝΑΝ ὌΨΙΝ
>
>  Wash the sins, not only the face
> [![A splash of philosophy!](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Ambigram_palindrome_%CE%9D%CE%99%CE%A8%CE%9F%CE%9D%CE%91%CE%9D%CE%9F%CE%9C%CE%97%CE%9C%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%91%CE%9C%CE%97%CE%9C%CE%9F%CE%9D%CE%91%CE%9D%CE%9F%CE%A8%CE%99%CE%9D_%28Wash_your_sins%2C_not_only_your_face%2C_in_Greek%29.jpg "Wash the sins, not only the face")](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Ambigram_palindrome_%CE%9D%CE%99%CE%A8%CE%9F%CE%9D%CE%91%CE%9D%CE%9F%CE%9C%CE%97%CE%9C%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%91%CE%9C%CE%97%CE%9C%CE%9F%CE%9D%CE%91%CE%9D%CE%9F%CE%A8%CE%99%CE%9D_%28Wash_your_sins%2C_not_only_your_face%2C_in_Greek%29.jpg)
{:style="text-align:center"}

In Sanskrit too, such palindromes exist as विलोम काव्य. लॊम meaning hair, विलोम = going against the hair *i.e.* reverse, and अनुलोम = going along the hair *i.e.* forward. दैवीशतकम् of आनन्दवर्धन has this verse where each line reads the same when in read in reverse.

> ###  सा भावक्षालवर्या नुतविभवितनुर्या वलक्षावभासा
> ###  जानानस्याशयप्रा नवनलिनवनप्रायशस्याननाजा ।
> ###  सातं वर्माननस्था रहसि रसिहरस्थाननर्मावतंसा
> ###  पायादक्ता रणत्रा मतनमनतमत्राणरक्ता दयापा ॥
{:style="text-align:center"}

Let's imagine a mirror along the center reflecting one side to the other, with perfect symmetry!

Another astonishing work, [रामकृष्णविलोमकाव्यम्](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_general/raamakrshhna.pdf) has 36 verses, all with their second lines being the reverse of their first! What's amazing is that the first lines speak of *Rama* and the second ones are of *Krishna*! It starts with

> ### तां भूसुता मुक्ति मुदारहासं वंदेयतो भव्य भवं दयाश्री: ।
>
> I pray to *Rama*, who rescued Sita from captivity, who has a majestic laugh, who is kind and who is an incarnation of *Vishnu*!
{:style="text-align:center"}

And the second in reverse, reads:
> ### श्री यादवं भव्य भतोय देवं संहारदामुक्ति मुता सुभूतां ॥
>
> I pray to *Krishna*, who shines with the Sun and the Moon as his eyes, who liberated *Putana* by killing her.
{:.rkAnuloma}

A similar work [राघवयादवीयम्](https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%98%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D), composed by *Sri Venkatadhvari* in the 17th century, has 30 such verses, with each verse read differently talks about *Rama* & *Krishna*!

### Guarded from all sides: सार्वतोभद्र
Let's look another seemingly simple verse from Kirātārjunīyam (15.25)

> ### देवाकानिनि कावादे
> ### वाहिकास्वस्वकाहि वा ।
> ### काकारेभभरे का का
> ### निस्वभव्यव्यभस्वनि ॥
> *O man who desires war! This is that battlefield which excites even the gods, where the battle is not of words. Here people fight and stake their lives not for themselves but for others. This field is full of herds of maddened elephants. Here those who are eager for battle and even those who are not very eager, have to fight.*

This extends the symmetry to another dimension, where it's symmetrical not just horizontally but also vertically.
