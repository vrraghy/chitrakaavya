A lof of us love poetry (kaavya). Chitrakavya is a kind of poem written with constraints in addition to the existing contraints like meters, etc., due to which they always exceed a reader's expectations.

Imagine walking through a gallery of paintings, and I hope this gives you a similar experience.

## Letter constraints: वर्ण-चित्र
It is tradition to start with an auspicious verse, and here's a chitrakaavya written by yours truly -

> ### <center>अरातिरातनोरात्त नारी तनुरनुत्तर: ।
> ### <center>तन्तनीतु त्रिनेत्रो निरार्तितां नो निरान्तरम् ॥
> ### <center>May three-eyed Shiva grant us good health. He is enemy of Love God, shares his body with Parvati as Ardhanarishvara, and is supreme.

If you haven't noticed yet, this contains only 3 consonants: **र**, **त** & **न**!

There can be other kinds of contraints too, and the results get increasingly interesting. Here's a verse which uses only 2 consonants - **र** & **त** - from [Vallabhadeva's *Subhashitavali (34,11)*](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.70521/page/n39/mode/2up)

> ### <center>तारतारतरेरैतैरुत्तरोत्तरो रुतै: ।
> ### <center>रतार्ता तित्तिरी रौति तीरॆ तीरॆ तरौ तरौ ॥
> ### <center>The love-sick *tittiri* bird cries out on every bank, on every tree, again and againm growing shriller and shriller

The choice of these consonants is surely not a random one, for these are some of the most frequent ones in the Sanskrit lexicon, which is why, a similar attempt with the consonants **ट** / **ठ** / **ढ** / **घ** would not be an easy one, simply because there are not as many words with them. So, there's quite a lot of thought involved in creating one, and even with these calculations, it's certainly a challenge, nonetheless.

## Other languages

Now, Sanskrit takes this art-form to heights unknown in other languages, but we do come across such. Charles Carroll Bombaugh, in of his [selections of such whimsical works](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56805/56805-h/56805-h.htm) full of alliterations, anagrams has a few *univocalic* verses - where only one syllable is used. e.g.

> ### No cool monsoons blow soft on Oxford dons,
> ### Orthodox, jog-trot, book-worm Solomons!

## Lipograms
A lipogram is one which omits a certain letter, and probably the greatest such work in English is Ernest Vincent Wright’s 1939 novel [Gadsby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel)) - it contains over 50,000 words but not a single instance of the letter **e**!

In Sanskrit too, there's an interesting application of a lipogram, employed not just as a challenge but with a poetic intent in itself, by the famous scholar [Daṇḍi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Di) who was possibly from the historic city of Kanchipuram, South India.
Written in the 7<sup>th</sup> or 8<sup>th</sup> century CE, one of his famous & surviving works, [Dashakumaracharita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashakumaracharita) is a tale of 10 young men who get separated for various reasons and later narrate each of their adventures upon reuniting, making for a joyous read. In the 7<sup>th</sup> chapter comes the turn for *Mantragupta* to relate his adventures.

When it comes to be the turn of *Mantragupta* to relate his adventures, he finds it painful to close his swollen lips as a result of all the nibbling by his beloved, during the passionate lovemaking the previous night, and hence refrains from using any labial consonants (**प**,**फ**,**ब**,**भ**,**म**) throughout his narrative!

> ### स किल करकमलनेन किंचित्संवृत्ताननो ललितवल्लभारभसदत्त दन्त क्षतव्य सनविह्व लाधर मणिर्निरोष्ठ्य वर्णं आत्मचरितं आचचक्षॆ
> That man (*Mantragupta*) half-covMantraguptaered his face with his lotus-like hands before beginning his own story. For his ruby lips were in an agony of agitation, perforated with bite marks that this beloved had bestowed in her forceful love-play. Hence he was compelled to speak without the labial lip sounds:p, b and m.

**Lipograms as a plot device**

अवान्तिसुन्दरीकथासार:, a summary of अवान्तिसुन्दरीकथा, another work by Daṇḍi has a character *Somadatta*, when afflicted by fever, and hence speaks only using the gentle consonants! It also makes one think if the author was alluding to the Tamil alphabets while writing in Sanskrit!

> ### <center>सोमादत्तत: सुहृत्प्रेम्णा स्वस्थीभूत: स तै: सह ।
> ### <center>प्रच्छाये क्कचनासीनो निगृह्य ज्वरवेदनाम् ।।
> ### <center>वर्गाद्यन्तान्तस्यै र्ऋऌवर्णविवर्जितै: स्वरैर्मृदुभि: ।
> ### <center>स चतुर्विंशतिवर्णै: स्वचरितमनुवर्णयांचके ।।

### Pangrams

A sentence that contains all the alphabets is called a pangram, and a lot of us would be familiar with this popular one
> A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

**Manavalli Gangadhara Sastri** (1834-1914), a *shatavadhani*  - one who performs a hundred things in parallel - was once given the following line as a prompt
> ### <center>बभौ मयूरो लवशॆषसिंह:
where the consonants are in the order their alphabetical order, and he replied
> ### <center>अनॆकवर्ण क्रमरीतियुक्त: कखागघाङच्छजझ्रा ञटौ ठ: ।
> ### <center>अडण्ढणस्तोऽथ दधौ न पम्फुल् बभौ मयूरो लवशॆषसिंह:

### Hidden Fourth Line / गूढचतुर्थपाद:
The constraint here is on the fourth line in that no new letter should be used. An verse from Kirātārjunīyam (15.43) shows how it's done!
> ### <center> द्युवियद्मामिनी
> ### <center> तारसंरावविहतश्रुति: ।
> ### <center> हैमाषुमाला शुशुभॆ
> ### <center> विद्युतामिव संहति: ॥
> ### <center> Shiva's golden arrows went across the sky
> ### <center> like shining lightning, making a loud bang

## Oulipo
Short for ***Ou**vroir de **li**ttérature **po**tentielle*, meaning *"workshop of potential literature"*, Oulipo is a group of French writers & mathematicians who seek to create works using constrained writing techniques, their motivation being
> Only if you  constrain the writing, you can understand the tru potential of what language can make us do!

## Palindromes

Palindromes those words / sentences which read the same forwards & backwards. Here's a Greek palindrome which was inscribed upon a holy water font outside the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, giving a splash of poetry.
> <center> ΝΊΨΟΝ ἈΝΟΜΉΜΑΤΑ, ΜῊ ΜΌΝΑΝ ὌΨΙΝ
> <center> Wash the sins, not only the face
> <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Ambigram_palindrome_%CE%9D%CE%99%CE%A8%CE%9F%CE%9D%CE%91%CE%9D%CE%9F%CE%9C%CE%97%CE%9C%CE%91%CE%A4%CE%91%CE%9C%CE%97%CE%9C%CE%9F%CE%9D%CE%91%CE%9D%CE%9F%CE%A8%CE%99%CE%9D_%28Wash_your_sins%2C_not_only_your_face%2C_in_Greek%29.jpg" width="80%"/></center>

In Sanskrit too, such palindromes exist as विलोम काव्य. लॊम meaning hair, विलोम = going against the hair *i.e.* reverse, and अनुलोम = going along the hair *i.e.* forward. दैवीशतकम् of आनन्दवर्धन has this verse where each line reads the same when in read in reverse.

> ### <center> सा भावक्षालवर्या नुतविभवितनुर्या वलक्षावभासा
> ### <center> जानानस्याशयप्रा नवनलिनवनप्रायशस्याननाजा ।
> ### <center> सातं वर्माननस्था रहसि रसिहरस्थाननर्मावतंसा
> ### <center> पायादक्ता रणत्रा मतनमनतमत्राणरक्ता दयापा ॥
