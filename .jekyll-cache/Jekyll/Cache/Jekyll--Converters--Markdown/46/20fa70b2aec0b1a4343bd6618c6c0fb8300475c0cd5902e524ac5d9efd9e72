<p>A lof of us love poetry (kaavya). Chitrakavya is a kind of poem written with constraints in addition to the existing contraints like meters, etc., due to which they always exceed a reader’s expectations.</p>

<p>Imagine walking through a gallery of paintings, and I hope this gives you a similar experience.</p>

<p>It is tradition to start with an auspicious verse, and here’s a chitrakaavya written by yours truly -</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="अरातिरातनोरात्त-नारी-तनुरनुत्तर-"><center>अरातिरातनोरात्त नारी तनुरनुत्तर: ।</center></h2>
  <h2 id="तन्तनीतु-त्रिनेत्रो-निरार्तितां-नो-निरान्तरम्-"><center>तन्तनीतु त्रिनेत्रो निरार्तितां नो निरान्तरम् ॥</center></h2>
</blockquote>

<p>which means</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="may-three-eyed-shiva-grant-us-good-health-he-is-enemy-of-love-god-shares-his-body-with-parvati-as-ardhanarishvara-and-is-supreme"><center>May three-eyed Shiva grant us good health. He is enemy of Love God, shares his body with Parvati as Ardhanarishvara, and is supreme.</center></h3>
</blockquote>

<p>If you haven’t noticed yet, this contains only 3 consonants: <strong>र</strong>, <strong>त</strong> &amp; <strong>न</strong>!</p>

<p>There can be other kinds of contraints too, and the results get increasingly interesting. Here’s a verse which uses only 2 consonants - <strong>र</strong> &amp; <strong>त</strong> - from <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.70521/page/n39/mode/2up">Shri Vallabhadeva’s Subhashitavali (34,11)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <h2 id="तारतारतरेरैतैरुत्तरोत्तरो-रुतै-"><center>तारतारतरेरैतैरुत्तरोत्तरो रुतै: ।</center></h2>
  <h2 id="रतार्ता-तित्तिरी-रौति-तीरॆ-तीरॆ-तरौ-तरौ-"><center>रतार्ता तित्तिरी रौति तीरॆ तीरॆ तरौ तरौ ॥</center></h2>
  <p>which means</p>
  <h2 id="the-love-sich-tittiri-bird-cries-out-on-every-bank-on-every-tree-again-and-againm-growing-shriller-and-shriller"><center>The love-sich *tittiri* bird cries out on every bank, on every tree, again and againm growing shriller and shriller</center></h2>
</blockquote>

<p>The choice of these consonants is surely not a random one, for these are some of the most frequent ones in the Sanskrit lexicon, which is why, a similar attempt with the consonants <strong>ट</strong> / <strong>ठ</strong> / <strong>ढ</strong> / <strong>घ</strong> would not be an easy one, simply because there are not as many words with them. So, there’s quite a lot of thought involved in creating one, and even with these calculations, it’s certainly challenge.</p>
